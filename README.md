## Combo Meal Recommendation System for Grocery Store

This project focuses on leveraging two years' worth of transactional data from a Grocery Store that does not currently offer combo meals. The primary objective is to identify the most popular combinations of menu items within customer orders. By analyzing the frequently occurring sets of menu items, the project aims to suggest new combo meal offerings to enhance customer satisfaction and boost sales.

### Problem Statement

The Grocery Store aims to optimize its product offerings and customer experience by introducing combo meals. However, it lacks the knowledge of which items are commonly purchased together. To address this challenge, I have implemented Market Basket Analysis, a powerful technique in retail analytics.

### Market Basket Analysis

Market Basket Analysis involves analyzing historical transaction data to identify associations and patterns among items frequently purchased together. This enables the discovery of potential combo meal combinations that can be introduced to attract and retain customers.

### Key Project Highlights

- Utilized two years' worth of transactional data for insights.
- Implemented Market Basket Analysis to identify frequently co-purchased items.
- Recommended combo meals based on customer buying behavior.
- Enhanced the Grocery Store's product offerings.
- Increased customer satisfaction and sales potential.
